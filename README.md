About the Samples
The samples...

require only basic developer or analyst skills and tools.
are easily hacked by simply changing data sources, titles, and making other minor configuration changes.
have an understated but pleasing look-and-feel.
show how you can consume data on Open Data DC in lots of clients: esri, D3, mapbox, leaflet, google maps
